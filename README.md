# Chess-o
### Making the Chess Game but wins the one with the last piece standing

**Chess-o** is a chess variant where the concept of check and checkmate does not exist.  
The objective is simple: **capture all of your opponent’s pieces**.

Kings are treated like normal pieces and can be captured.  
There are no illegal positions related to check, allowing for more aggressive and tactical gameplay focused entirely on material advantage.

This variant encourages constant attacks, sacrifices, and creative strategies rather than traditional king safety.

## Lore
I started this project because I wanted to take part at Midnight in Vienna, an Hackclub Event, for several reasons I didn't have the possibility to do it and I have abbandoned the project at a point. 
Then after some months I started working on it again and came up with this version that isn't totally bug free, but surely I'm really proud.
The best part of this project was when I was working on the movement system of all pieces. It was really difficult, but probably one of the most satisfying things I have ever achieved.

I loved to design all the pieces using this palette that in my opinion makes a cool effect.

Surely, it needs more work for a completely finished version, but there's always a start. 

Have any suggestions? Feel free to contact me.
